>
> **Purpose**: Provides a technology-agnostic overview of system features for AI assistants, developers, and stakeholders. Should be referenced in the main README.md as essential reading for understanding system capabilities.
>
> **Maintenance**: AI assistants should recommend updates when implementing new features or discovering undocumented capabilities to keep this document aligned with the actual system.

## Overview

URL Summarizer is a web-based application that automatically extracts and summarizes content from any web page URL. The system transforms lengthy articles, blog posts, and web content into concise, structured summaries with key points and sentiment analysis. Built as a reference implementation of the micro-block architecture pattern, it demonstrates AI-collaborative software development principles while providing real utility for content consumption and research.

## Out of Scope

| ID | Feature Name | Reason for Exclusion |
|----|--------------|----------------------|
| X01 | User Authentication | Demo focuses on architecture pattern, not user management |
| X02 | Bulk URL Processing | Single URL processing demonstrates pattern sufficiently |
| X03 | Custom AI Model Training | Uses existing AI services to focus on architecture |
| X04 | Content Editing | Read-only summarization maintains simplicity |
| X05 | Advanced Analytics | Data analysis beyond sentiment is outside core use case |
| X06 | Mobile App | Web interface demonstrates pattern without platform complexity |

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Micro-block | Small, independent command that performs one specific function with clear contracts |
| Command Registry | System for discovering and instantiating commands dynamically |
| Pipeline | Sequential execution of commands where output of one becomes input of next |
| Summary Metadata | Additional information about the summary including sentiment, key themes, and source details |

## Notes

- System prioritizes architectural demonstration over feature completeness
- All external dependencies (OpenAI API) are user-provided to avoid service costs
- Memory storage is intentionally simplified for demo purposes
- Each command is designed for easy AI understanding and modification
- Pattern can be extended to more complex workflows and different domains
