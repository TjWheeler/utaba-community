feat: Add MCP_SANDBOX_NOQUOTA environment variable

- Added noQuota boolean to SandboxConfig interface
- Added MCP_SANDBOX_NOQUOTA environment variable (default: false)
- QuotaManager deletes existing quota file on startup when no-quota mode enabled
- All quota checks and updates bypassed when noQuota=true
- Quota status returns "quota disabled" message when disabled
- Added comprehensive test coverage for no-quota mode
- Updated README with configuration examples and security warnings
- Enhanced startup logging to highlight when quota is disabled
- Maintains full quota functionality for when quota is re-enabled

Security considerations:
- Explicit opt-in only (never default)
- Clear security warnings in logs and documentation
- Use only in trusted development environments
- Performance benefit: eliminates quota tracking overhead

Breaking changes: None - fully backwards compatible
