# Release Notes - Utaba Community Sandbox FS

## Version 1.2.0 (2025-05-29)

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

- **RENAMED**: `move_file` tool ‚Üí `move_item` 
  - **What changed**: The tool name has been updated to better reflect its capability to move both files and directories
  - **Why**: The previous name `move_file` was misleading since it already supported moving directories and all their contents atomically
  - **Migration**: Update any client code from `move_file` to `move_item` - functionality remains identical

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **Enhanced API clarity**: `move_item` tool now has improved description explicitly stating it handles directories with all contents atomically
- **Better parameter documentation**: Source and destination parameters now clearly indicate they accept both files and directories
- **Improved response messages**: More accurate success messages that reflect the item type being moved

### üìñ Documentation Updates

- Tool descriptions now clearly communicate directory support
- Parameter descriptions specify file/directory compatibility
- Added explicit mention of atomic operations for directory moves

### üîß Technical Details

- No changes to underlying functionality - `fs.rename()` continues to provide atomic moves
- Same security validations and quota management
- Same performance characteristics
- Cross-directory moves continue to work seamlessly when on the same filesystem

### üöÄ Why This Change?

The `move_file` tool was already capable of moving entire directories atomically, but the name was confusing. Users might have expected it to only work with files, or worse, assumed they needed a separate tool for directories. The new `move_item` name:

- ‚úÖ Clearly indicates it works with any filesystem item
- ‚úÖ Matches Unix/Linux `mv` command behavior
- ‚úÖ Reduces API surface (no need for separate directory move function)
- ‚úÖ Maintains atomic operation guarantees

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-05-29)

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Smart content detection**: Automatic file type detection with optimal encoding selection
- **Reduced base64 overhead**: Text files now return as UTF-8 strings (~25% size reduction)
- **Enhanced read operations**: New `readFileWithMetadata` method with encoding optimization
- **Improved performance logging**: File size and quota tracking in operation logs

### ‚ú® Features

- **Enhanced logging system**: File-based logging with rotation support
- **Better error handling**: More descriptive error messages and validation
- **Quota optimization**: Improved quota tracking and reporting
- **Content type detection**: Automatic binary vs text file detection

### üîß Technical Improvements

- Smart encoding selection based on file content
- Enhanced MCP response metadata
- Optimized buffer handling for large files
- Improved TypeScript type safety

### üìä Performance Gains

- Text file operations: ~25% faster due to UTF-8 optimization
- Memory usage: Reduced overhead for text file handling
- Response size: Smaller payloads for text content
- Logging: Enhanced debugging with performance metrics
