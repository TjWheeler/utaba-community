# Utaba Community - SandboxFS Activity Log

> **Instructions for Claude**: This is the activity log for the Utaba Community SandboxFS project. Update this file as significant developments occur.

## Project Overview
**Description**: Secure sandbox filesystem MCP server for AI-human collaboration
**Repository**: `projects/utaba-community/mcpservers/utaba-community-sandboxfs`
**Status**: Production Complete
**Current Version**: 1.3.0

## Recent Activity

### 2025-06-01 - Append File Method Disabled
**Type**: Bug Fix / Simplification
**Description**: Disabled the append_file tool due to persistent file corruption issues
**Reason**: 
- File locking complexity introduced race conditions
- Mixed encoding scenarios caused corruption (text vs binary appends)
- Quota tracking complications with incremental updates
- Edge cases around concurrent access not worth the complexity

**Solution**: Removed `mcp_sandboxfs_append_file` from tool definitions in index.ts
- Tool interface already commented out
- Implementation remains in fileOperations.ts but is unused
- Users can achieve append functionality using read + write pattern

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates file corruption risk
- Simpler, more predictable operations
- Atomic write operations only
- Better quota management
- No locking overhead

**Status**: Complete - tool disabled, system more reliable
