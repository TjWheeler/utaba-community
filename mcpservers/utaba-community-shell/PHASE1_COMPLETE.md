Phase 1 implementation completed with 4 core components:

✅ **Approval Queue** (`src/approvals/queue.ts`)
- File-based approval request management
- Atomic operations with manifest tracking
- Risk assessment and timeout handling
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

✅ **Approval Server** (`src/approvals/server.ts`) 
- Express-based browser UI with mandatory token auth
- REST API for approval actions
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Mobile-responsive approval interface

✅ **Approval Manager** (`src/approvals/manager.ts`)
- High-level coordination between queue and server
- Automatic server lifecycle management
- Clean shutdown and error handling

✅ **Command Executor Integration** (`src/commandExecutor.ts`)
- Approval workflow for commands requiring confirmation
- Seamless integration with existing security validation
- Enhanced statistics and status reporting

**Technical Implementation:**
- Mandatory token authentication for security
- File-based communication matching Agent Hub patterns
- Browser auto-launch with approval dashboard
- Complete audit trail with decision tracking
- Real-time UI updates via Server-Sent Events

**Usage Flow:**
1. `npx` command triggers approval request
2. Browser automatically opens with approval UI
3. User reviews command details and risk assessment
4. Decision processed and command proceeds/fails
5. Complete audit trail maintained

The approval system successfully addresses the security gap for `npx` commands while maintaining workflow efficiency. Ready for testing and further development.
